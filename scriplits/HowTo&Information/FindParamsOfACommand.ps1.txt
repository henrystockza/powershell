<#This Is how you find parameters of a command

1) Set your variable and call the command you want with get command.
2) Be careful not to leave it openended otherwise you going to get a huge output. i.e get-command get-*
3) Now use $a.ParameterSets to see whats listed in the parameters.
4) You now have all the information on what parameters are available on the get-process command. #>



$a=get-command get-process
$a.ParameterSets[0]
