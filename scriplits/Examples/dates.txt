H, %H			The hour in a 24-hour clock. Single-digit hours will not have a leading zero. Specify "%H" if the format pattern is not combined with other format patterns.
HH			The hour in a 24-hour clock. Single-digit hours will have a leading zero.
m, %m			The minute. Single-digit minutes will not have a leading zero. Specify "%m" if the format pattern is not combined with other format patterns.
mm			The minute. Single-digit minutes will have a leading zero.
M, %M			The numeric month. Single-digit months will not have a leading zero. Specify "%M" if the format pattern is not combined with other format patterns.

yyy			The year in three digits. If the year is less than 100, the year is displayed with a leading zero.
yyyy			The year in four or five digits (depending on the calendar used), including the century. Will pad with leading zeroes to get four digits. Thai Buddhist and Korean calendars both have five digit years; users selecting the "yyyy" pattern will see all five digits without leading zeros for calendars that have five digits. Exception: the Japanese and Taiwan calendars always behave as if "yy" was selected.
%c			Where c is a format pattern if used alone. That is, to use format pattern "d", "f", "F", "h", "m", "s", "t", "y", "z", "H", or "M" by itself, specify "%d", "%f", "%F", "%h", "%m", "%s", "%t", "%y", "%z", "%H", or "%M". The "%" character can be omitted if the format pattern is combined with literal characters or other format patterns.
\c			Where c is any character. Displays the character literally. To display the backslash character, use "\\".
